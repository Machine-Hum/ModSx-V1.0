R0.1 -> First Implementation
R0.2 -> Holy shit .brd NFG... rails were fucked, regulator com fucked,
	Diodes were fucked... lots of changes from R0.1 to R0.2...
	CHECK GERBERS OVER AGAIN BEFORE GETTING R0.2 FABBED
	F0.1.JPEG FOR FIX, NOTE 3 BREAKS, 2 DIODE JUMPS AND 3 OTHER JUMPS
	5V REGULATOR MOST LIKELY ALSO FUCKED, SO MORE STRIKES & JUMPS THEN
	SHOWN, HAD NO 5V DURING FIX. Maybe Remove diodes... add imput
	protection.
     -> FIX RAILS OUTDATED
R0.3 -> UGGGGGGGGGGG what the fuck why did you just order 0.2 that was a complete waste of
	money. Welp now 0.3's happening... 1. 10V Voltage reference 2. POWER JACK JESUS FUCK
